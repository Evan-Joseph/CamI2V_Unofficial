idx=0, txt=A view from inside a home, showing a suburban backyard through a glass door. the backyard features a lush green lawn, a wooden fence, and a patio area with a grill covered in black, a metal bistro set, and a potted plant with red flowers, all under a clear blue sky. two houses are visible in the background, one with a brick facade and the other with a white exterior and dark roof shingles. at the two-second mark, the scene shifts slightly to show the same backyard with a metal bistro set, a grill, and a potted plant with red flowers, with a 'welcome' sign on the fence, maintaining the tranquil suburban atmosphere._fs=3.0
