idx=0, txt=A serene lakeside scene at inland dance trail in elkhart lake, with a wooden dock leading to calm waters where boats and jet skis are moored. the sky is overcast, and the scene is quiet, with no people visible. the dock is lined with various boats, including speedboats and jet skis, and the surrounding greenery adds to the tranquility. the video is part of a news broadcast, as indicated by the lower third graphic. contrary to the detailed scene, the overall video is described as showing a close-up of a sign with a map of the united states, which seems unrelated to the described lakeside setting._fs=4.0
