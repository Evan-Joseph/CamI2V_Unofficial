idx=0, txt=A cozy living room with beige walls and light brown trim, furnished with a dark blue leather sofa set, including a recliner and two armchairs with red accent pillows. a wooden dining table with matching chairs is set for four, and a potted plant adds a natural touch. the room is well-lit by natural light from large windows with white trim and a ceiling fan. at the two-second mark, the scene shifts to a sunroom with a vaulted ceiling, where the same dark blue leather sofa set is seen, now with a wooden coffee table and a potted plant, all under the warm glow of natural light._fs=6.0
