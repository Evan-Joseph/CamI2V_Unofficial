idx=0, txt=A warmly lit interior hallway with terracotta walls and beige tiled flooring. an open door reveals a bathroom with light wood vanity and white countertops, while another door leads to a bedroom with a white bed and blue curtains. a framed abstract painting in silver frame adorns the wall. as the video continues, the hallway is shown again with the same open door to the bathroom and the bedroom, now with a double bed and dark curtains. the painting remains a focal point, and the lighting casts a soft glow, creating a cozy atmosphere._fs=5.0
